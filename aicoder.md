# ACI Process Activities - AI Agent Project Memory & Prompt

## Purpose
This file serves as the persistent memory, context, and prompt for all AI agents working on the ACI Process Activities project. It must always be kept in sync with the Docs/ folder and reflect the current state, structure, and goals of the project.

---

## Gotchas & Issues Log
- Always log any issues, blockers, technical gotchas, or important context here as soon as they arise.
- This section is critical for ensuring any agent can pick up where the last left off, even after a crash or handoff.
- Include error messages, troubleshooting steps, workarounds, and links to related TODOs or documentation.

*No known gotchas or issues at this time.*

---

## Task & TODO Management
- All project tasks must be tracked in `Docs/TODO.md`.
- Whenever a new task is assigned, started, or completed, update both this file (aicoder.md) and `Docs/TODO.md` to reflect the current status.
- Reference related TODO items in the Gotchas & Issues Log or Project Status sections as needed.
- Use clear, actionable descriptions for each task.
- Mark tasks as complete in both locations when finished.
