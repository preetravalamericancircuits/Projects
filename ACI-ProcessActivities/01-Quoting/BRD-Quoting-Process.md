## Document Information
- **Process**: Quoting
- **Document Version**: 1.0
- **Last Updated**: July 17, 2025
- **Owner**: Operations Team
- **Review Cycle**: Quarterly

## Executive Summary
This document defines the business requirements for the quoting process in contract manufacturing operations, covering RFQ intake through quote delivery and follow-up activities.

## Process Overview
The quoting process transforms customer requests for quotation (RFQ) into detailed, accurate pricing proposals that enable informed decision-making for both customer and manufacturer.

## Business Objectives
- Provide accurate, competitive quotes within agreed timeframes
- Maintain profitability through proper cost analysis
- Ensure compliance with quality and regulatory requirements
- Track quote-to-order conversion rates
- Support strategic customer relationship management

## Stakeholders
- **Primary**: Sales Team, Engineering, Purchasing, Operations Manager
- **Secondary**: Quality Assurance, Finance, Customer Service
- **External**: Customers, Suppliers, Regulatory Bodies
- **Interviewed Stakeholders for Process Improvements**: Larry (Data/Process Feedback), Cathy (Purchasing/Quoting Feedback), Pratiksha (Purchasing/Quoting Feedback), Praful (Engineering/Quoting Feedback)

## Functional Requirements

### 1. RFQ Intake and Management
- **RFQ Reception**: Accept RFQs via email, portal, phone, trade shows
- **Initial Review**: Validate completeness and feasibility
- **Categorization**: Classify by complexity (simple, standard, complex)
- **Assignment**: Route to appropriate technical personnel
- **Tracking**: Maintain status throughout quote lifecycle

### 2. Technical Analysis
- **Design Review**: Analyze PCB layouts, schematics, assembly drawings
- **Manufacturability Assessment**: DFM (Design for Manufacturing) evaluation
- **Capability Matching**: Verify alignment with facility capabilities
- **Compliance Check**: Ensure adherence to quality standards (ISO 9001, ITAR, RoHS)
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify technical and commercial risks

### 3. Cost Estimation
- **Material Costing**: BOM analysis, supplier pricing, lead times
- **Labor Estimation**: Assembly time, test time, setup requirements
- **Overhead Allocation**: Facility costs, equipment depreciation
- **Tooling Requirements**: Fixtures, stencils, programming costs
- **NRE Costs**: Non-recurring engineering charges

### 4. Quote Generation
- **Pricing Structure**: Unit prices, setup costs, tooling charges
- **Volume Breaks**: Quantity-based pricing tiers
- **Terms and Conditions**: Payment terms, delivery schedules
- **Validity Period**: Quote expiration dates
- **Alternative Options**: Value engineering suggestions

### 5. Quote Delivery and Follow-up
- **Formal Quote Submission**: Professional quote package delivery
- **Customer Communication**: Technical discussions, clarifications
- **Revision Management**: Quote updates and version control
- **Win/Loss Tracking**: Outcome analysis and feedback capture
