## Stakeholder Feedback: Larry’s & Praful's Suggestions for Process and System Improvements

1. **Inventory Tracking for PQSI Orders**
   - Implement a tracking system for PQSI inventory to better manage and forecast future order requirements.

   - Standardize work order numbers and extensions to denote variations (e.g., 23243-1 for 2m, 23243-2 for 4m, etc.).
   - Use L for Lead-Free, M for Military, and ITAR for government/military projects.

3. **Traveler Information and Process Flow**
   - Ensure traveler information is included with each job, specifying operation sequence, required certifications, and notes for operators.

4. **Verification of Labels**
   - Add a verification step for label accuracy to ensure all required labels are present and correct, matching part, customer, and shipment labels.
