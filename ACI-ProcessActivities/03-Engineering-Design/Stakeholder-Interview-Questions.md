## Stakeholder Feedback: Praful's Suggestions for Process and System Improvements

1. **Setup Panel from Gerber File**
   - Clearly define and assign the process of setting up a panel from a Gerber file to specific roles (Precheck and Practicing teams).
   - Ensure all required layers and files are correctly formatted and responsibilities are assigned for initial setup.
